# Grapher

This is an SVG-based interactive graph editor that allows you to manually lay out nodes and edges but at the same time produce a clean graph-like JSON that can be consumed easily with libraries like Cytoscape JS. At the same time, the code is declarative and minimal enough that it can be tweaked easily to give you users an Interactive diagram as well.

## TODO

- Children nodes' layout
- Export SVG
- Dashed edges
- Dropping one need on another to create it as a child
- Delete node (with/without dependents)
