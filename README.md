This is an SVG-based interactive graph dataset editor that allows you to manually lay out nodes and edges but at the same time produce a clean graph-like JSON that can be consumed easily with libraries like Cytoscape JS. You can add arbitrary data fields at nodes and edges. The code is declarative and minimal enough that it can be tweaked easily to give your users an interactive diagram.

## TODO

- Better path and z-index calculation for edges
- Performance testing (1000 nodes?)
